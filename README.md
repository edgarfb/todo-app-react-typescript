## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

I decided to solve this challenge without no library or framework to get a more deeper knowledge about javascript and DOM and I happy with my job. But also I figure out I need to keep going learnig becouse there is a lot to lear yet, and that is exciting to me. 
Now to the next level.

### Continued development

I'm going to learn React or improve my basic knowledge about Angular. Also I'm going read more about design pattern, data structure and algorithms to improve my code.
